 * `project-state-current` note, the prior head, and a bounded transcript reference) whenever the
 * payload does not supply one. An explicitly supplied extension still wins: that is how
 * /ruvnet-brain:checkpoint hands over a state the model actually wrote.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately NOT done here:
 *   • `.swarm` is never created. Its absence means the project has not adopted the brain, and a
 *     lifecycle hook that plants a store in every repository the user opens is trespass (see above).
 *   • No exception escapes. A capture boundary that can fail a turn is worse than a missed snapshot.
